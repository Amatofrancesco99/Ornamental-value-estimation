  <summary><b><strong>SETTING UP THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT</strong></b></summary>

### 1) Clone this repo
...and navigate to its root directory.

  
### 2) Create a python virtual environment 
...calling it '.my_env' 

(For gitignore-related reasons).

```
$ python3 -m venv .my_env
```

(You'll be prompted to install the 'venv' module if you haven't it yet).

  
### 3) Activate the virtual environment:

```
$ source ./my_env/bin/activate
```

If this command doesn't work try with:

```
$ . .my_env/bin/activate
```

(You should notice that the console starts displaying the virtual environment's name before your username and the dollar-sign).

  
### 4) Install this app's dependencies 
... on the virtual environment you just created:

```
(.my_env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
