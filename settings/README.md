# MongoDB `settings` directory

The file `db_config.csv` in this directory should contain the configuration settings needed to connect to the MongoDB instance.

The file format should be as follows:

```
key,val
username,<your-username-here>
password,<your-password-here>
database,<your-database-name-here>
cluster,<your-cluster-address-here>
```
